## Liri-Node-App: a node-based application that takes userinput from the command-line and returns data from OMDB, Spotify, and Bandsintown respectively.

### When the user runs the app in node, they are prompted to decide which function they want to use. Once they make a selection, the console outputs the appropriate command for them to type into the console.
* The user may search for:
    * Movies
    * Songs
    * Concert
### Once the specific search is input on the command line, the app returns the appropriate data to the console and logs it in the log.txt file.
